# src/__init__.py
# The __init__.py file is used to mark a directory as a Python package. It can be empty, or it can be used to perform initialization for the package or to expose specific functions or classes when the package is imported.

# In the context of the rag_llm_project/src/ directory, the __init__.py file can remain empty if there's no specific initialization needed. However, if you want to make it easier to import the modules or classes, you can add import statements inside the __init__.py file.
